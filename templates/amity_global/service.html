                    We place utmost importance in following global standard of compliance to ensure fair, ethical and
                    responsible recruitment. We protect our workers from the fraud and unethical practices by providing them
                    with the right information, proper guidance and counseling. We have been providing workers with the
                    information and guidance related to fair and ethical recruitment through counseling and workshop
                    sessions. Apart from that, we have also been providing pre-departure orientation to the workers prior to
                    their departure and provide a thorough awareness regarding the working hours, duties and
                    responsibilities, salary and allowance, country and company overview, departure and arrival process,
                    airport system and several rules and regulations. The main objective of our pre-departure training is to
                    provide the workers with support to deal with the cultural, professional, social and personal challenges
                    they would confront in the destination country.
